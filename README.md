# get_next_line
May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

## About the project
The `get_next_line` project is part of the 42cursus, designed to teach students how to read from a file descriptor, one line at a time, without knowing its size beforehand. This project helps in understanding and implementing efficient file reading mechanisms.

### Key Requirements
- Read from a file descriptor and return the next line.
- Manage multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Handle memory efficiently to avoid leaks.
- Ensure the function works with any buffer size.

### Skills Learned
- File I/O operations in C.
- Dynamic memory allocation and management.
- Handling edge cases and errors.
- Developing efficient algorithms for reading data.
- Working with static variables and multiple file descriptors.
